## College of Lore

### Cutting Words

You've learned how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.
When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.
The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.
As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.
During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.

The performance ends early if you are incapacitated, silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

# Character Traits

## Dark vision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

## Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you.
That creature gains one Bardic inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds ar fails.
Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost.
A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.
The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a dl0 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Font of Inspiration
Starting at 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

## Jack of All Trades

You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Song of Rest

You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.
If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1dl0 at 13th level, and to 1dl2 at 17th level.

> The creature regains the extra hit points only if it spends one or more of its own hit dice at the end of the short rest.

# Feats

## Magic Initiate

You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list.
You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level.
Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

## Lucky
You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

You have 3 luck points.
Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20.
You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.
You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you.
Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.
If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice).
Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw.

Any attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.

> This spell was acquired through the Magic Initiate feat, and can only cast it at its lowest level. Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

### Cure Wounds
*1st-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Touch

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A creature you touch regains a number of hit points equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

> **At Higher Levels:**
> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Thunder Wave
*1st-level evocation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self (15-foot cube)

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you.
Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you.
On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

In addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

> **At Higher Levels:**
> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

### Comprehend Languages
*1st-level divination (ritual)*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)

**Duration:** 1 hour

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear.
You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written.

This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a written language.

### Disguise Self
*1st-level illusion*

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** Self

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself - including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person - look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it.
You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between.
You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

- While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

A remove curse spell ends this effect.
At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above.

### Remove Curse
*3rd-level abjuration*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Components:** V, S

**Duration:** Instantaneous

At your touch, all curses affecting one creature or

### Mass Healing Word

**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V

**Duration:** Instantaneous

### Polymorph
*4th-level transmutation*

**Casting Time:** 1 action

**Range:** 60 feet

**Components:** V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)

**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

This spell transforms a creature that you can see
within range into a new form. An unwilling creature
must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the
effect. A shape changer automatically succeeds on this
saving throw.

The transformation lasts for the duration, or until
the target drops to zero hit points or dies. The new form
can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or
less than the target's (or the target's level, if it doesn't
have a challenge rating). The target's game statistics,
including mental ability scores, are replaced by the
statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment
and personality.

The target assumes the hit points of its new form.
When it reverts to its normal form, the creature
returns to the number of hit points it had before it
transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to
zero hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't
reduce the creature's normal form to zero hit points, it isn't
knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by
the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells,
or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The
creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit
from any of its equipment.

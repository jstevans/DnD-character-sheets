# History

## Back Story
Thia is from a once flourishing Elven city, with no crime, war, poverty or disease in a very distant land. Since then, the city was attacked by an army of the undead and it's master(s). Now the city no longer resembles what it once did and no longer shows itself and any recent maps.

She is from a great noble house, know for their honor, resolve and magical power. The head of the house, before the city was destroyed, was Thia's mother and was known for being very kind and whole hearted kindness, but merciless when it counts.

Another person who survived, was the head of the houses guard. Who saved Thia was the disaster in the first place, but was separated from here some time later. Thia has little memory of this as she was rather young when the everything happened (7-9 years old)

Thia's father was out of the city at the time as he traveled a lot. Once he got word that the city was attacked, he returned to find his girl missing and began to look for her. He has not seen his girl since she was a very small child, so it's going to quite challenging to find her.

### Personal Traits
Has learned lessons for every situation, drawn from observing nature.

### Ideals
Fights for the greater good and for the needs of the many. She trying to find a sense of purpose, and aspires to restore the greatness of her formal house.

### Bonds
Strong bonds to the unspoiled wilderness

### Flaws
Resents anyone and everyone who has ever wronged me, and will even go to the extents of killing them to exact my revenge.

## Affiliations

### Wardens of the Hunt (*Guild*)

#### Wardens of the North (*Guild Party*)
Traveling party of a few fellows that were previously prisoners.

### Falcons Hollow
Was in Falcon's Hollow originally to trade trapped animals for other items before the game started.

## College of Lore

### Cutting Words

You've learned how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.
When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.
The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

### Countercharm

At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects.
As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.
During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage
on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.

The performance ends early if you are incapacitated, silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).

# Character Traits

## Dark vision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

## Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you.
That creature gains one Bardic inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost.
A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.
The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Font of Inspiration
Starting at 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

## Boon of Dimensional Travel

As an action, you can cast the *Misty Step* spell, without using a spell slot or any components. Once you do so, you can't use this boon again until you finish a short rest.

## Jack of All Trades

You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Song of Rest

You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.
If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1dl0 at 13th level, and to 1dl2 at 17th level.

> The creature regains the extra hit points only if it spends one or more of its own hit dice at the end of the short rest.

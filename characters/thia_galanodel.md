# History

## College of Lore

### Cutting Words

You've learned how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.
When a creatare that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature's roll.
You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage.
The creature is immune if it can't hear you or if it's immune to being charmed.

# Traits

## Darkvision

Thanks to your elf blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions.
You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.
You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

## Fey Ancestry

You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can't put you to sleep.

## Bardic Inspiration

You can inspire others through stirring words or music.
To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you.
That creature gains one Bardic inspiration die, a d6.

Once within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes.
The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds ar fails.
Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost.
A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once).
You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.
Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class.
The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a dl0 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.

### Font of Inspiration
Starting at 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.

## Jack of All Trades

You can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

## Song of Rest

You can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.
If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.

The extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1dl0 at 13th level, and to 1dl2 at 17th level.

> The creature regains the extra hit points only if it spends one or more of its own hit dice at the end of the short rest.

# Feats

## Magic Initiate

You learn two cantrips of your choice from that class's spell list.

In addition, choose one 1st-level spell from that same list.
You learn that spell and can cast it at its lowest level.
Once you cast it, you must finish a long rest before you can cast it again.

## Lucky
You have inexplicable luck that seems to kick in at just the right moment.

You have 3 luck points.
Whenever you make an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw, you can spend one luck point to roll an additional d20.
You can choose to spend one of your luck points after you roll the die, but before the outcome is determined.
You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

You can also spend one luck point when an attack roll is made against you.
Roll a d20, and then choose whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.
If more than one creature spends a luck point to influence the outcome of a roll, the points cancel each other out; no additional dice are rolled.

You regain your expended luck points when you finish a long rest.

You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.

The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.
If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
